Hello!

I am a Computer Systems Engineering student with an insatiable thirst for knowledge. Every day, I am excited to discover something new, especially in the exciting world of technologies like progressive web app development and AI. I love the feeling of immersing myself in new languages ​​and exploring unknown experiences.

In my linguistic arsenal I know:

- Spanish (my native language)
- English (I speak at an intermediate level)
- Chinese (I'm taking my first steps in this fascinating language)
  
When it comes to programming languages, I already know:

- Python
- PHP
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

And believe me, this list is destined to grow in the near future.

As for the technologies that interest me:

- Svelte: I think it's an amazing tool for web application development!
- Keras: I'm excited to further explore artificial intelligence through this platform.
- Ionic:  I find the idea of ​​creating mobile apps exciting!
  
So here I am, eager to absorb everything the world of technology has to offer. See you on the next adventure!
